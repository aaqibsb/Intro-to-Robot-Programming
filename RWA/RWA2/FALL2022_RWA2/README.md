# FALL2022_RWA2

Implementation of the "wall following" algorithm using OOP and C++ with backtracking for a simulated robotic mouse placed in a maze. The algorithm can be switched prioritizing the left turn or right turn to find the goal. After the goal is reached, the mouse travels back to the start eliminating the redundant paths.
